# Analysis of Year 4 Math Chapter 2: Whole Number (Part 2)

## Overview
**Subject**: Mathematics  
**Topic**: Whole Numbers (Rounding, Estimation, Factors, and Multiples)  
**Target Audience**: Primary 4 (Singapore Math Syllabus)  
**Document**: `Y4 Math Chapter 2 Whole Number(Part 2).tex`

This document provides a pedagogical analysis of the worksheet questions, breaking down the learning objectives, skills tested, and the specific educational purpose of each section. The worksheet transitions from foundational procedural fluency (rounding) to conceptual understanding (factors/multiples) and culminates in higher-order thinking word problems.

## Detailed Section Analysis

### 1. Rounding Whole Numbers
**Questions**: 1–20
- **Scope**: Rounding to the nearest ten (Q1-10) and nearest hundred (Q11-20).
- **Pedagogical Goal**: 
  - To reinforce the student's understanding of **Place Value**.
  - To practice the specific algorithmic rule of rounding: looking at the digit to the right of the target place value (0-4 round down, 5-9 round up).
  - **Specific Challenge**: Inclusion of "9"s (e.g., $39,917$, $59,999$) tests the student's ability to handle "rollover" cases where rounding affects higher-order place values (e.g., rounding 59,999 to the nearest ten results in 60,000).

### 2. Estimation in Operations
**Questions**: 21–34
- **Scope**: Estimating sums, differences, products, and quotients.
- **Pedagogical Goal**: 
  - To conceptualize estimation as a tool for checking reasonableness, rather than just a mechanical process.
  - **Q21-26 (Rounding to nearest ten)**: Focuses on quick mental math approximations for addition and subtraction.
  - **Q27-34 (Mixed Operations)**: Extends estimation to multiplication and division.
    - *Division estimation (Q31-32)*: Likely tests the concept of **compatible numbers** (finding numbers close to the dividend that are easily divisible by the divisor), rather than strict rounding rules.

### 3. Factors and Common Factors
**Questions**: 35–37, 38–40
- **Scope**: Finding all factors of given numbers and identifying common factors between two numbers.
- **Pedagogical Goal**: 
  - **Systematic Listing**: The layout (e.g., $12 = \_ \times \_$) forces students to use the "Factor Pair" strategy, starting from $1 \times N$, $2 \times \dots$, ensuring no factors are missed.
  - **Square Numbers**: Q37 ($36$) tests if students recognize that a square number has an odd number of factors because one pair repeats ($6 \times 6$).
  - **Common Factors**: Q38-40 introduces the concept of intersection between two sets of numbers. Noteworthy is that the pairs (8 & 16, 14 & 28, 9 & 18) involve one number being a multiple of the other, illustrating that in such cases, the factors of the smaller number are the common factors.

### 4. Multiples and Common Multiples
**Questions**: 41–46
- **Scope**: Listing first $n$ multiples, finding specific $n$-th multiples, and common multiples.
- **Pedagogical Goal**: 
  - To distinguish clearly between **Factors** (finite, $\le$ number) and **Multiples** (infinite, $\ge$ number).
  - Introduction to the foundation of LCM (Lowest Common Multiple).
  - **Pattern Recognition**: Finding the "$n$-th multiple" (Q43, Q44) reinforces the link between multiples and multiplication tables.

### 5. Application and Word Problems
**Questions**: 47–55
- **Scope**: Real-world scenarios and Number Theory riddles.
- **Pedagogical Goal**: 
  - **Q47-50 (Contextual Problems)**: Application of calculation followed by rounding.
    - *Q47 (Estimation)*: Explicitly asks to round *before* estimating (a key distinction from rounding the final answer).
    - *Q48 (Reverse Operation)*: Requires algebraic thinking ($x + 7982 = 25000 \rightarrow x = 25000 - 7982$) before rounding.
    - *Q50 (Multi-step)*: Students must calculate the "Afternoon" value first, find the "Total", and then round. A common mistake here is rounding intermediate values instead of the final total.
  - **Q51-55 (Number Theory/Thinking Skills)**:
    - These are **Heuristic/Logic** questions designed to test deep conceptual understanding.
    - *Q51*: "Smallest 2-digit number with only 4 factors". Requires testing numbers systematically ($10: 1,2,5,10$).
    - *Q52-53*: Logic puzzles combining definitions of Factors, Multiples, and Range constraints. (e.g., "Multiple of 8, between 20 and 30, factor of 48" $\rightarrow$ 24).
    - *Q55*: "Common multiples... 14 and 28". Tests understanding that common multiples share the same base factors (2 and 7).

## Teacher's Note
This worksheet is balanced, moving from rote practice (drills on rounding) to structured conceptual scaffolding (fill-in-the-blanks for factors), and ending with "Thinking Math" questions that require synthesis of the concepts defined earlier. It effectively prepares students for more complex topics like HCF (Highest Common Factor) and LCM (Lowest Common Multiple) and Arithmetic Word Problems.
